Contributing to AdMaply

Thank you for your interest in contributing to AdMaply.

AdMaply is a personal development project maintained by a single developer. Contributions are welcome, but the project prioritizes clarity, simplicity, and long-term maintainability over rapid feature expansion.

Before You Start

Please:

Open an Issue first to discuss significant changes.

Keep pull requests focused and minimal.

Avoid large, unrelated refactors in a single PR.

Ensure your changes align with the project's scope and goals.

Development Guidelines

Keep the architecture simple.

Prefer readable code over clever code.

Avoid unnecessary dependencies.

Do not introduce breaking changes without discussion.

Follow existing code style and structure.

If tests exist, ensure they pass before submitting a PR.
If adding new functionality, consider adding corresponding tests.

Security & Responsibility

Do not commit:

Secrets or credentials

Sensitive data

Personal user data

If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow the process described in SECURITY.md and report it privately.

Project Philosophy

AdMaply is designed as a lightweight, self-hostable mapping and route planning tool.

The goal is not to compete with large commercial platforms, but to provide a minimal, transparent, and hackable alternative.

Simplicity is a feature.

Code of Conduct

Be respectful and constructive in discussions.
This project values clarity, curiosity, and technical honesty.

AI-Assisted Development

Parts of this project were developed with the help of AI coding tools, primarily OpenAI’s Codex. Codex and similar tools can accelerate writing boilerplate or exploratory code, but all contributions are reviewed, tested, and guided by a human developer.

Using AI tools does not replace human understanding. You should verify that any code added or modified meets the project’s quality, security, and style standards.

If you contribute to this project using AI tools, please be transparent about your usage in your pull request description — mention which tools you used and how they assisted (e.g., code suggestion vs. documentation generation).
